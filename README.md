# covid_analysis
My family was very worried about the covid situation in SLC (where I work) so I send them covid report (in Chinese) everyday. Ended up making this a small project.

The region, SLC, is harded coded in the code (Python & VBA) but can be easily changed to a variable for customized report for desired cities.

Originally, I was looking to use reportlab or dashboard tools instead of excel. But I encountered major difficulties regarding Chinese Font compatiblity issues when I try to use thee labraries. Hope to sort it out one day.

run sevice.py and the daily SLC report will be generated in the report folder
